TASK 1 :
This project implements a Boston House Price Prediction regression model using Python's scikit-learn library. The solution utilizes a dataset containing key features like number of rooms, crime rates, and other local factors to predict median house values. The process follows a standard machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling features using StandardScaler), model training (employing Linear Regression as the baseline algorithm), and evaluation. The model's predictive accuracy is quantified using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and
the R2  Score, providing a robust, data-driven tool for estimating property values in the Boston real estate market.

TASK2 :
This project develops an  machine learning model for car selling price prediction and analysis using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The core objective is to provide an accurate estimate of a used car's value based on key features, including its fuel type, years of service, showroom price, number of previous owners, kilometers driven, seller type, and transmission type. The project follows a standard data science pipeline: it starts with data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values and performing one-hot encoding for categorical variables), moves to defining and splitting the data, and finally trains the ensemble-based Random Forest model. The model's performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and
R-squared (R2), ensuring a robust system that can be deployed to offer users an approximate and reliable selling price for their vehicles.

TASK3:
 Personalized Content Generator 
This repository hosts a robust, enterprise-grade Personalized Content Generator built as a capstone for an AI/ML internship. The project focuses on the local deployment and in-depth analysis of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically the LiquidAI/LFM2-2.6B model, using 4-bit quantization for efficient, API-free inference. Unlike basic LLM wrappers, this system simulates a production workflow by integrating advanced features: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via a proprietary knowledge base to ground content; Brand Voice Customization via detailed system prompts; and Simulated A/B Testing using VADER sentiment analysis to calculate a Performance Score (Simulated ROI) for generated copy. The final analysis uses quantitative metrics (Term Frequency, Word Count) and visualizations to definitively prove the model's success in adapting content across various enterprise personas (Tech, Marketing, General Public). This project showcases proficiency in LLM deployment, advanced prompt engineering, data analysis, and application robustness.
